# Automated-Attendance-system

An automatic attendance system is an educational ERP system that records the students' attendance in an institution. Unlike the conventional attendance system, the automatic attendance software enables the faculty to record, store, and monitor students' attendance history & manage the classroom efficiently.
The automatic attendance system is designed & developed to record studentsâ€™ attendance. The educators & students get their individual logins & password that could be used to mark & record the daily attendance at a centralized location.
The crucial class-time can be saved with a student attendance system, which is an automated solution to not only mark attendance but also to find out meaningful patterns in order to monitor student performance around key metrics and contribute towards student security.
